For that we are using B8 (NIR) band as a sharpening band and B3 as a dummy Blue band for HSV conversion.\n","\n","Walking Through the Script's Logic\n","Now let's look at the key lines of the function and why they are there.\n","\n","1. Creating the \"Blurry Painting\"\n","\n","```python\n","coarse_bands = image.select(['B12', 'B11', 'B2'])\n","```\n","Why? To use the HSV transform, we need a three-band RGB image. We assign the two SWIR bands we want to sharpen (B12 and B11) to the Red and Green channels. We need a third band for the Blue channel, so we just grab another 20m band (like B2) as a placeholder. This creates our \"blurry color painting.\"\n","\n","2. Separating Color from Detail\n","\n","```python\n","hsv = coarse_bands.rgbToHsv()\n","```\n","Why? This is the core step. We convert our \"blurry painting\" from the RGB model to the HSV model. This gives us three separate layers: Hue (the blurry color), Saturation (the blurry color intensity), and Value (the blurry detail).\n","\n","3. Swapping the Detail Layer\n","\n","```python\n","pan = image.select('B8') # This is our \"sharp pencil sketch\"\n","sharpened_hsv = ee.Image.cat([hsv.select('hue'), hsv.select('saturation'), pan])\n","```\n","Why? This is the \"magic\" of the fusion.\n","\n","We take the original hue and saturation bands (preserving the original, correct color information).\n","\n","We throw away the blurry value band from the original hsv image.\n","\n","We replace it with our sharp, high-resolution pan image (the 10m NIR band).\n","\n","We now have a new HSV image with blurry colors but sharp detail.\n","\n","4. Rebuilding the Final Image\n","\n","```python\n","sharpened_rgb = sharpened_hsv.hsvToRgb()\n","```\n","Why? We convert the new, hybrid HSV image back into the standard RGB color model for display and analysis. The output is a single, three-band image.\n","\n","The Red channel of this new image is the sharpened B12, and the Green channel is the sharpened B11. They now have the spatial detail of the 10m NIR band while retaining their original SWIR color properties. That's why the final steps rename the bands to B12_sharp and B11_sharp for clarity.\n","\n","It might be helpful but I have to check it otherwise.\n","\n","\n","```python\n","def sharpen_s2_swir(image):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Pansharpens the 20m SWIR bands of a Sentinel-2 image to 10m.\n","\n","    Args:\n","        image (ee.Image): A Sentinel-2 image with at least B8, B11, and B12.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        ee.Image: The original image with sharpened 'B11_sharp' and 'B12_sharp' bands added.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Select the high-resolution band to use for sharpening (NIR is a good choice)\n","    pan = image.select('B8') # 10m\n","\n","    # Select the 20m bands to be sharpened.\n","    # We add a dummy Blue band (B2) to create a 3-band image for HSV conversion.\n","    coarse_bands = image.select(['B12', 'B11', 'B2']) # SWIR2, SWIR1, Blue\n","\n","    # Convert the coarse image to HSV color space.\n","    hsv = coarse_bands.rgbToHsv()\n","    hue = hsv.select('hue')\n","    saturation = hsv.select('saturation')\n","\n","    # Swap the coarse 'value' band with the high-resolution panchromatic band.\n","    # The result is a sharpened HSV image.\n","    sharpened_hsv = ee.Image.cat([hue, saturation, pan]).hsvToRgb()\n","\n","    # Rename the sharpened bands to avoid confusion\n","    sharpened_bands = sharpened_hsv.rename(['B12_sharp', 'B11_sharp', 'B2_ignore'])\n","\n","    # Add the newly sharpened 10m SWIR bands to the original image\n","    return image.addBands(sharpened_bands.select(['B12_sharp', 'B11_sharp']))\n","\n","\n","# --- Example Usage ---\n","\n","# Load a Sentinel-2 image\n","s2_image = ee.Image('COPERUS/S2_SR_HARMONIZED/20240415T044031_20240415T044031_T45RVP')\n","\n","# Run the sharpening function\n","sharpened_image = sharpen_s2_swir(s2_image)\n","\n","# Now calculate MNDWI using the new sharpened B11 band\n","mndwi_sharpened = sharpened_image.expression(\n","    '(GREEN - SWIR1_SHARP) / (GREEN + SWIR1_SHARP)', {\n","        'GREEN': sharpened_image.select('B3'),\n","        'SWIR1_SHARP': sharpened_image.select('B11_sharp')\n","    }\n",").rename('MNDWI_sharp')\n","\n","# --- Visualization to Compare ---\n","Map = geemap.Map()\n","Map.centerObject(s2_image, 13)\n","\n","# Original MNDWI (GEE automatic resampling)\n","mndwi_original = s2_image.normalizedDifference(['B3', 'B11']).rename('MNDWI_original')\n","Map.addLayer(mndwi_original, {'min': -0.5, 'max': 1, 'palette': ['red', 'white', 'blue']}, 'Original MNDWI (Blocky)')\n","\n","# Sharpened MNDWI\n","Map.addLayer(mndwi_sharpened, {'min': -0.5, 'max': 1, 'palette': ['red', 'white', 'blue']}, 'Sharpened MNDWI (10m)')\n","\n","Map\n","```\n","> **Note** - This is a common practice for the visualization of the MNDWI.

the depth of the water, such that if the water is clean then the optical depth would be higher.\n","\n","### **How Secchi Depth is Estimated via Remote Sensing**\n","\n","1. **Theoretical Basis:**\n","   - Secchi Depth is linked to water clarity and is proportional to the diffuse attenuation coefficient ($K_d$), which describes how light is attenuated in the water column.\n","   - Satellite sensors (like Landsat, Sentinel-2) measure water-leaving reflectance in visible bands (especially blue and green). These reflectance values are used to estimate $K_d$, and hence, to model Secchi Depth.\n","\n","2. **Typical Empirical Approach:**\n","   - **Retrieve water-leaving reflectance ($R_{rs}$)** from the satellite image (usually at blue and green wavelengths).\n","   - **Use published empirical relationships** between Secchi Depth (SD) and $R_{rs}$ or Band Ratios.\n","     - Example (for Landsat/Sentinel-type sensors):\n","       $$\n","       SD = a \\times (R_{rs,blue}/R_{rs,green})^b\n","       $$\n","       or\n","       $$\n","       \\log(SD) = c_0 + c_1 \\log(\\frac{R_{rs,blue}}{R_{rs,green}})\n","       $$\n","     - The coefficients $(a, b, c_0, c_1)$ are determined by regression using local calibration data (in situ SD vs satellite reflectance).\n","\n","3. **Practical Steps:**\n","   - **Atmospheric correction**: Ensure surface reflectance product is atmospherically corrected (Sentinel-2 Level-2A, Landsat SR etc.).\n","   - **Select appropriate bands:**\n","     - Sentinel-2: B2 (Blue, 490 nm), B3 (Green, 560 nm)\n","     - Landsat 8/9: Band 2 (Blue), Band 3 (Green)\n","   - **Apply empirical or published formula**:\n","     - For example, a widely used model for lakes:\n","       $$\n","       \\log(SD) = 1.485 - 2.267 \\log(\\frac{R_{rs,Blue}}{R_{rs,Green}})\n","       $$\n","\n","4. **GEE Example (Sentinel-2, rough outline):**\n","\n","```python\n","# Assuming you have a water mask and surface reflectance composite\n","blue = water_masked_img.select('B2') # 490 nm\n","green = water_masked_img.select('B3') # 560 nm\n","sd_log = blue.divide(green).log().multiply(-2.267).add(1.485)\n","secchi_depth = sd_log.exp().rename('Secchi_Depth')\n","\n","# Visualization\n","Map.addLayer(secchi_depth, {'min': 0, 'max': 5, 'palette': ['navy', 'aqua', 'yellow']}, 'Secchi Depth (m)')\n","```\n","\n","5. **Notes:**\n","   - **Accuracy depends strongly on calibration!** Validate with local SD measurements if possible.\n","   - Open-access literature (see references like Song et al. 2013, Olmanson et al. 2016, Pitarch et al. 2019) provides formulas for different water types and satellites.\n","   - Works best for clear to moderately turbid waters; very high turbidity reduces accuracy.\n","\n","***\n","\n","**In summary:**  \n","Yes, Secchi Depth can be estimated via remote sensing, using blue/green reflectance ratios and published or regionally calibrated regressions.
